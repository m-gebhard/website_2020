            "description": "X-Lights is probably my largest programming project, it combines a variety of technologies to create an unique LED controller. Sound's simple, and to be honest, it is, but a lot of simplicity brings complexity. With X-Lights (to be renamed) you can control multiple LED strips all over the world. You can synchronize them, or let them all play their own unique show. X-Lights also supports sensors as inputs - you could use a light sensor to turn on your lights when it's dark, or let them glow red when your room has a certain temperature. As a programmer you can also easily create new light modes and extend existing functionality.<br><h4 class='project-overlay__content-description-sub-headline'>X-Lights consists of:</h4><ul class='project-overlay__content-description-list'><li class='project-overlay__content-description-list-item'>A NodeJS Server running a websocket</li><li class='project-overlay__content-description-list-item'>A Vue.js webapp to control the lights</li><li class='project-overlay__content-description-list-item'>A Wemos D1 Mini microcontroller</li><li class='project-overlay__content-description-list-item'>A small C# client that analyzes music</li></ul><br><br><a class='project-overlay__content-description-link' href='https://github.com/m-gebhard/x-lights-demo' target='_blank'>GitHub Demo Repo</a>"

This board can be used with any microcontroller that has at least 7 digital pins and a 5V output. Each switch has an led above, all of them can be controlled separately. The board can be used as a mini keypad, a media controller (HID), or any other application that needs switches. For the first PCB project, I think it turned out very nice, what do you think? If you're interested, take a look at the schematics and maybe create something own with it?<br><br><a class='project-overlay__content-description-link' href='#' target='_blank'>Schematic + PCB (wip)</a><br><a class='project-overlay__content-description-link' href='https://github.com/m-gebhard/cherry-mx-keypad' target='_blank'>Media Controller Repo</a>",
