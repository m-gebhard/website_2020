            "description": "X-Lights is probably my largest programming project, it combines a variety of technologies to create an unique LED controller. Sound's simple, and to be honest, it is, but a lot of simplicity brings complexity. With X-Lights (to be renamed) you can control multiple LED strips all over the world. You can synchronize them, or let them all play their own unique show. X-Lights also supports sensors as inputs - you could use a light sensor to turn on your lights when it's dark, or let them glow red when your room has a certain temperature. As a programmer you can also easily create new light modes and extend existing functionality.<br><h4 class='project-overlay__content-description-sub-headline'>X-Lights consists of:</h4><ul class='project-overlay__content-description-list'><li class='project-overlay__content-description-list-item'>A NodeJS Server running a websocket</li><li class='project-overlay__content-description-list-item'>A Vue.js webapp to control the lights</li><li class='project-overlay__content-description-list-item'>A Wemos D1 Mini microcontroller</li><li class='project-overlay__content-description-list-item'>A small C# client that analyzes music</li></ul><br><a class='project-overlay__content-description-link' href='https://marius12375.github.io/#/' target='_blank'>Here's a little Demo</a><a class='project-overlay__content-description-link' href='https://github.com/marius12375/x-lights-demo' target='_blank'>GitHub Repo</a>"
